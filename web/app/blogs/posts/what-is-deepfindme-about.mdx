I've always been fascinated by how much **data** is publicly available, yet **most people don’t realize it**. You leave **traces of yourself everywhere**—from your social media accounts to metadata in images, public databases, and even **forgotten old forum posts**.  

🔎 **DeepFind.Me** is my attempt at **giving people power over their own information.**

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-cyan-400 my-4">Why Build This? </h2> 

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-400 my-4">A few reasons: </h3>  

- **1. People don’t realize how much of their personal info is public.**  
- **2. There’s no single, easy-to-use OSINT tool for the average person.**  
- **3. I love cybersecurity & digital investigations, so why not build something cool?** 

The goal is **not** to encourage hacking or illegal activities—but to **educate, inform, and empower** people to **take control of their own digital presence**.
